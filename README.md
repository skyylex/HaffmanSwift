Haffman compression algorithm implemented in Swift. 

Project was built as a try for creating some algorithmic work for in Swift.

### Limitations

Current implementation is strongly depends on the String type. And as result doesn't work on some binary data.
To apply this implementation in real world applications you should do additional work to fix this.
