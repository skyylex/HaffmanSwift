## HaffmanSwift

Haffman compression algorithm implemented in Swift. 

Project was built as a try for creating some algorithmic work for in Swift.

### Limitations

Current implementation has a strong dependency on the Swift.String, as a consequence the implementation doesn't work for arbitrary binary data. To apply this implementation in real world applications you should do additional work to fix this.
