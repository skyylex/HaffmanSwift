## HaffmanSwift

Haffman compression algorithm implemented in Swift. 

The project was built as a playground to check how it would feel to implement some classic Computer Science in Swift.

### Limitations

Current implementation has a strong dependency on the Swift.String, as a consequence the implementation doesn't work for arbitrary binary data. To apply this implementation in real world applications you should do additional work to fix this.
